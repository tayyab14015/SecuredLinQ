SecuredLinQ
Secure Video Communication and Load Management System
Built with Go (Golang) and React
________________________________________
Overview
SecuredLinQ is a web-based logistics and communication platform that combines secure real-time video communication with a structured load management system. The system is designed for scenarios where administrators need to remotely coordinate with drivers, verify operations via live video calls, and manage logistics workflows in a controlled and auditable manner.
The project emphasizes backend-centric system design using Go, following Clean Architecture principles, while the frontend provides a modern, responsive user interface built with React and TypeScript.________________________________________System Architecture
SecuredLinQ follows a client–server architecture:
•	Backend: Go-based REST API responsible for all business logic, security, persistence, and third-party integrations
•	Frontend: React SPA that consumes backend APIs and provides role-based user interfaces
•	Database: MySQL
•	Storage: AWS S3 for media assets
•	Video Communication: Agora RTC with cloud recording
All authentication, authorization, validation, and security enforcement are handled on the backend.

Backend Overview (Go)
The backend is implemented using Clean Architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and long-term maintainability.
Backend Layers
•	Handlers – HTTP request handling
•	Services – Business logic
•	Repositories – Database access
•	Models – GORM entities
•	Middleware – Authentication & authorization
Core Backend Responsibilities
•	Session management and role validation
•	Load lifecycle management
•	Agora token generation and recording control
•	Media handling and S3 integration
•	Email notifications
•	Audit-friendly API design
________________________________________
Frontend Overview (React)
The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) that communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
Frontend Capabilities
•	Admin dashboard for load and driver management
•	Driver interface for assigned loads
•	Integrated video call UI
•	Screenshot capture and recording controls
•	Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
Authentication Flow
1.	User logs in (admin or driver)
2.	Backend sets secure session cookie
3.	Frontend automatically includes cookie in requests
4.	Protected routes validate session via backend

API Communication
•	Frontend communicates with backend via REST APIs
•	Cookies handle session persistence
•	All sensitive operations are validated server-side
•	Video tokens and media access are generated by backend only
